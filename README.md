# Mini LMS Module (CRM Integrated) — Backend API

A backend API for a simplified **Learning Management System (LMS)** designed as a
module within a larger CRM ecosystem. It exposes an API-first surface suitable for
multiple portals (Admin CRM, Student Portal, Mobile apps), with JWT authentication,
role-based access control, relational data modelling and progress analytics.

## Architecture

A strict, one-directional **layered architecture**. A layer never calls upward or
skips a level:

```
route → controller → service → repository → (Prisma) → PostgreSQL
                          │
                          ├─→ helpers   (reusable domain logic)
                          └─→ utils     (generic, stateless utilities)
```

| Layer          | Responsibility                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **route**      | Registers path/method + middleware; calls the controller only            |
| **controller** | Parses request, calls service, formats response — *zero* business logic   |
| **service**    | Owns all business logic; orchestrates repositories/helpers/utils          |
| **repository** | Prisma queries only; returns Prisma models; *zero* business logic         |
| **middleware** | Auth, validation, error handling — standalone, never inside controllers   |
| **helpers**    | Reusable, domain-specific logic (password, JWT, progress maths)           |
| **utils**      | Generic stateless utilities (logger, response formatter, pagination)      |

> **No models layer.** Because Prisma generates entity types directly from
> `schema.prisma`, there is no hand-written ORM-model layer. Plain TypeScript
> DTOs/interfaces live in `types/` with a `.types.ts` suffix.

### Export & import convention

Every service, repository, controller and helper defines **standalone named
functions** and exports them in a single block at the bottom of the file
(`export { login, getProfile }`). Consumers use namespace imports
(`import * as authService from '...'`) so call sites stay readable
(`authService.login(...)`) while each unit remains independently mockable.

**Constants vs. serializers vs. utils**

- `constants/` — every cross-cutting magic value (HTTP status codes, page sizes,
  JWT expiry, bcrypt rounds, completion threshold, bearer scheme). Each constant is
  a typed, frozen (`as const`) object exposed by a named export.
- `serializers/` — functions that know a **specific resource's shape** and produce
  its response DTO (e.g. `toSafeUser`, `toCourseProgress`). Services never build
  response shapes inline; they call a serializer.
- `utils/` — **generic, reusable-for-any-type** helpers (`groupBy`, `roundTo`,
  pagination). If a function references `User`/`Course`/etc. it belongs in
  `serializers/`; if it works for any type it stays in `utils/`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 18
- PostgreSQL ≥ 13 (or Docker)

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env — at minimum set DATABASE_URL and JWT_SECRET
```

### 3. Set up the database

```bash
# create the schema — applies the single baseline migration in one step
npm run prisma:deploy        # or: npm run prisma:migrate  (dev, creates new migrations)

# generate the Prisma client
npm run prisma:generate

# seed an admin + demo data (optional)
npm run db:seed
```

The project ships a **single baseline migration** (`prisma/migrations/20260624000000_init`)
that builds the entire schema — including `deleted_at` on every table — in one step.
To wipe and rebuild a development database from scratch, use `npx prisma migrate reset`
(drops the DB, re-applies the baseline migration, then runs the seed).

### 4. Run

```bash
npm run dev        # hot-reload dev server (ts-node-dev)
# or
npm run build && npm start
```

API base: `http://localhost:3000/api` · Docs: `http://localhost:3000/api/docs`

### Run with Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
# brings up PostgreSQL + the API, runs migrations automatically
```

### Tests

Tests are split into two suites:

```bash
# Unit tests — mock the DB, bcrypt and JWT; run anywhere, no services needed
npm test                 # alias: npm run test:unit
npm run test:coverage    # unit tests with a coverage report

# Integration tests — full request→response flow against a real Postgres
docker compose up -d db
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/mini_lms_test \
  npm run test:integration
```

- `tests/unit/**` mirrors `src/**` one-to-one (services, repositories, serializers,
  helpers, utils). External dependencies are mocked, so no database is required.
- `tests/integration/**` is organised by route module (auth, students, courses,
  lessons, enrollments, progress, reports). A `globalSetup` applies the migration to
  the test database and each test truncates tables beforehand so state never leaks.
  Set `TEST_DATABASE_URL` (or `DATABASE_URL`) to a disposable Postgres database.

## Environment Variables

| Variable             | Required | Default                  | Description                                   |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `NODE_ENV`           | no       | `development`            | `development` \| `test` \| `production`       |
| `PORT`               | no       | `3000`                   | HTTP port                                     |
| `API_PREFIX`         | no       | `/api`                   | Base path for all routes                      |
| `DATABASE_URL`       | **yes**  | —                        | PostgreSQL connection string                  |
| `JWT_SECRET`         | **yes**  | —                        | Secret for signing JWTs (≥ 10 chars)          |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`     | no       | `1d`                     | Token lifetime (e.g. `1h`, `7d`)              |
| `BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS` | no       | `10`                     | bcrypt cost factor                            |
| `SEED_ADMIN_*`       | no       | see `.env.example`       | Seed admin name/email/password                |

Environment is validated at boot via Joi (`src/config/env.ts`) — the process exits
with a clear message if a required variable is missing or malformed.

---

## Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT bearer tokens.** Send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on protected routes.
- **Separate login** for admins (`/auth/admin/login`) and students
  (`/auth/student/login`). Login is role-scoped: an admin cannot authenticate via the
  student endpoint and vice-versa.
- **RBAC** is enforced by `authorize(...roles)` middleware. `/admin/*` routes require
  `ADMIN`; `/student/*` routes require `STUDENT`.
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt; hashes are never returned in any response.

---

## Response Format

Every endpoint returns a consistent envelope.

**Success**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Students fetched successfully",
  "data": [ ... ],
  "meta": {
    "page": 1, "limit": 10, "totalItems": 42,
    "totalPages": 5, "hasNextPage": true, "hasPrevPage": false
  }
}
```

**Error**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "errors": [{ "field": "email", "message": "email must be a valid email" }]
}
```

| Status | Meaning                                  |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| 200    | OK                                       |
| 201    | Created                                  |
| 400    | Validation / bad request                 |
| 401    | Missing/invalid token, bad credentials   |
| 403    | Authenticated but not authorised         |
| 404    | Resource not found                       |
| 409    | Conflict (duplicate email / enrollment)  |
| 500    | Unexpected server error                  |

All list endpoints accept `?page=` and `?limit=` (max 100) and return `meta`.

## Database Schema

Five tables: `users` (admins + students via a `role` enum), `courses`, `lessons`,
`enrollments`, `video_progress`. All tables carry `created_at` / `updated_at`.

```

### Constraints & indexes

- **Foreign keys** between every related table, with `onDelete` rules
  (`Cascade` for owned children, `SetNull` for the optional `assigned_by`).
- **Unique constraints:** `users.email`, `enrollments (student_id, course_id)`,
  `video_progress (student_id, lesson_id)`.
- **Indexes** on frequently queried fields: `users.role`, `users.email`,
  `lessons.course_id`, `enrollments.student_id`, `enrollments.course_id`,
  `video_progress.student_id` / `lesson_id` / `course_id`, plus a `deleted_at`
  index on every table (filtered on every read).

### Soft delete

Every table has a nullable `deleted_at`. **Deletions are soft only** — the
repository sets `deleted_at = now()` instead of issuing a SQL `DELETE`, and every
read filters `deletedAt: null` (including nested `include`s and `_count`s, so
lesson lists and counts never include deleted rows).

**Approach — manual filtering in the repository layer (chosen).** Prisma offers two
native-ish options, both rejected here:

1. **`$use` query middleware** — deprecated in Prisma 5 in favour of client
   extensions, so building new code on it is a dead end.
2. **`$extends` client extensions** — viable, but global query interception is a
   footgun: it silently rewrites `findUnique`→`findFirst`, doesn't reliably filter
   nested relation reads/`_count`, and has to be bypassed for any "include deleted"
   path (restore, audits), which spreads conditional logic anyway.

Since the repository is already the *single* place queries are issued, filtering
there is explicit, visible at the call site, correctly handles nested
`include`/`_count`, and is trivially unit-testable — with none of the global-hook
surprises. The cost is discipline (each new query must add the filter), which the
layered architecture already enforces by funnelling all Prisma access through
repositories.

> Note: the `users.email` unique constraint still spans soft-deleted rows, so an
> email belonging to a soft-deleted user cannot be reused; this surfaces as a clean
> `409 Conflict`. Left as-is to avoid a behavioural change.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Strict layering, dependency flows down only.** Controllers never touch Prisma;
  repositories never contain business rules. This keeps business logic testable and
  the data layer swappable.
- **Functional modules over method-objects.** Each unit is a set of standalone named
  functions exported in one block; consumers namespace-import them. This keeps
  functions single-responsibility and individually mockable.
- **Module-level dependency injection.** Rather than a DI container, dependencies are
  injected at the module boundary: a unit imports the modules it needs, and tests swap
  them with `jest.mock(...)` (see `tests/unit/services/auth.service.test.ts`). This
  fits the functional export style while keeping units isolated under test.
- **Single shared Prisma client** (`config/db.ts`) to reuse the connection pool and
  avoid exhausting database connections.
- **API docs live beside the code they describe.** Route documentation is split into
  one `*.swagger.ts` file per route module under `swagger/`; `swagger/index.ts` holds
  the base spec (info, servers, security) and merges the modules into the served document.
- **No magic values.** Every cross-cutting literal lives in `constants/` as a typed,
  `as const` object; modules import the constant instead of repeating the value.
- **Response shaping is isolated in serializers.** Services compute data and hand it to
  a resource-specific serializer that builds the response DTO, so the wire shape has one
  home per resource. Generic, type-agnostic helpers (`groupBy`, `roundTo`) stay in `utils/`.
- **Centralised error handling.** Services throw a typed `ApiError`; one middleware
  translates `ApiError`, Prisma errors (`P2002` → 409, `P2025` → 404, `P2003` → 400)
  and unknowns into the consistent error envelope. Production hides internal messages.
- **Validate + sanitise at the edge.** A Joi `validate` middleware checks `body`,
  `params` and `query`, strips unknown keys and applies type coercion/defaults before
  the request reaches a controller.
- **N+1 avoidance.** List/detail reads use Prisma `include`/`select` and `_count`
  (e.g. courses-with-lessons, enrollments-with-student/course). Reports fetch progress
  rows in a single query and aggregate in-memory by bucketing on `courseId`/`studentId`
  rather than querying per entity. `video_progress.course_id` is denormalised so
  course-level reports avoid extra joins.
- **90%-completion rule** lives in `helpers/progress.helper.ts` (`resolveCompletion`),
  so the policy has one home and is unit-tested independently of HTTP/DB.
- **Resume support.** `video_progress.last_position_seconds` stores the resume point;
  progress writes are idempotent upserts keyed by `(student_id, lesson_id)`.
- **Role-scoped login** prevents privilege confusion and returns a uniform "Invalid
  credentials" message to avoid user enumeration.
- **bcryptjs** is used as the bcrypt implementation — a pure-JS, API-compatible port —
  to keep installs/builds free of native compilation across environments.
